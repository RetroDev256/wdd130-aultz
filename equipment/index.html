                    Standardized Equipment
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Buhurt is a high-intensity full-contact combat sport that brings the medieval battlefield to life with
                    authenticity and rigor. To ensure both safety and fairness, all participants are required to wear standardized
                    equipment that meets strict historical and protective guidelines. This includes meticulously crafted plate armor,
                    chainmail, and weaponry designed for durability and competitive combat. Standardized gear not only upholds the
                    traditions of medieval warfare but also guarantees a level playing field, allowing fighters to focus on skill,
                    strategy, and endurance in the heat of battle.
