        What is Buhurt?
	      Buhurt is a type of full-contact combat sport that simulates medieval battles, often involving teams of armored fighters engaging in simulated warfare. Derived from the term "bu hurt," which means "to hit" in Old French, Buhurt is a highly physical and tactical sport where participants wear historical armor and use blunt weapons such as swords, axes, and shields. It is known for its intense and brutal nature, combining elements of martial arts, strategy, and teamwork. Fighters in Buhurt often compete in large-scale battles or one-on-one duels, with the goal of outmaneuvering and overpowering their opponents, all while adhering to rules that ensure safety despite the intensity of the action. Buhurt is both a modern sport and a form of historical reenactment, drawing inspiration from medieval combat techniques and tournaments.

        Underlayers
        -	Gambeson: Beneath the metal armor, fighters are required to wear padded garments to absorb impacts and reduce the risk of injury. This includes a padded gambeson or jacket, which provides additional comfort and protection.
        -	Neck Protection: A coif or collar, made of padded fabric or metal, is used to protect the neck from strikes.

        -	Sword: A longsword or one-handed sword with a blunt edge, typically made of steel but designed to avoid injury during combat.
        -	Axe: A battle axe, designed with a blunt edge, is also a common weapon in Buhurt.
